## 📋 Expense Splitting Rules & Context

These rules clarify which expenses are intentional subsets vs. full group splits:

### **Rule 1: Early Trip Expenses (Before Diego Arrived)**
- **Applies to**: Expenses #1, #2, #3
- **Payer**: Joseph
- **Split**: 8 people (excludes David and Diego who weren't present yet)
- **Status**: ✅ **INTENTIONAL** — Diego missed early days
- **Detail**: These are correctly split among people who were actually on the trip

### **Rule 2: Intentional Subset Splits (People at that specific event)**
- **Applies to**: Expenses #6, #9, #12, #16, #17
- **Examples**:
  - #6: Side expense for Joseph + David only (R$ 215)
  - #9: Hayley's shared item with Nick & Bruna (R$ 196.90)
  - #12: Beach outing with Joseph, Antonio, Alex only (R$ 1,753)
  - #16: Empanadas for Alex, David, Diego, Joseph (R$ 160)
  - #17: Uber ride for David, Diego, Joseph (R$ 100)
- **Status**: ✅ **INTENTIONAL** — These are person-specific or event-specific expenses
- **Rule**: Only people who consumed/attended pay their share

### **Rule 3: Activity Exclusions (People not on the activity)**
- **Applies to**: Expenses #15, #21
- **#15 Boat groceries**: Excludes Hayley (not on boat trip) — 9 people pay
- **#21 Suibi dinner**: Excludes Tyler & Hayley (not present for that dinner) — 8 people pay
- **Status**: ✅ **INTENTIONAL** — People can't be charged for expenses they didn't participate in

### **Rule 4: Fees & Discounts Pro-Rated (iFood Lunch)**
- **Applies to**: Expense #22 (iFood lunch, R$ 435.68)
- **Detail**: Coupon (−R$ 10) and delivery/service fees (R$ 19.98) were fairly distributed among 6 people based on meal prices
- **Status**: ✅ **CORRECT** — Fees pro-rated proportionally, not split equally
- **Reference**: See detailed breakdown in **iFood Lunch Breakdown** section below

---

## ✅ Accounting Status

### **CLEAN & VERIFIED**
- ✅ Early expenses before Diego = intentional (he wasn't there)
- ✅ Subset expenses (couples' outings, specific attendees) = intentional
- ✅ Activity exclusions (boat, specific dinners) = intentional
- ✅ iFood fees properly pro-rated = mathematically correct

### **NO CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND**
All major "questions" from prior analysis are resolved by the rules above. The accounting is solid.

---

## 🔄 Ledger Merge & Deduplication Analysis

### Data Sources
Two separate expense tracking systems were used during the trip:
1. **Chat-ledger** (chatgpt): 37 expenses tracked in the group chat (R$ 32,530.72)
2. **Splitwise**: 33 expenses logged in formal Splitwise system (R$ 44,649.37)
3. **INITIAL MERGED TOTAL**: 70 expenses (R$ 77,180.09)

### Deduplication Results

**4 DUPLICATES IDENTIFIED & REMOVED**

Initial analysis found 6 amounts appearing in both ledgers. Upon detailed comparison:
- **4 confirmed duplicates** (same payer, same split group): Removed Splitwise versions
- **2 different expenses** (different payers): Kept both

#### Confirmed Duplicates Removed:

| # | Amount | Chat-Ledger Description | Splitwise Description | Payer | Split Group | Action |
|---|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | R$ 2,025.00 | BBQ groceries | Groceries | Antonio | All 10 | ✗ Removed SW |
| 2 | R$ 1,870.00 | Beach club lunch | Lunch (dry fish...) | Nick | 9 people | ✗ Removed SW |
| 3 | R$ 272.00 | Wine | Groceries | Antonio | All 10 | ✗ Removed SW |
| 4 | R$ 215.00 | Side expense (Joseph+David) | Dranks girls | Antonio | 2 people | ✗ Removed SW |

**Deduplication Decision**: Kept chat-ledger versions because they have more specific descriptions and were created closer to the spending time.

#### Different Expenses (Kept Both):

| Amount | Chat-Ledger | Splitwise | Payers | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| R$ 150.00 | Uber for hike (Alex) | Dinner (Tyler) | Different | ✓ Kept both |
| R$ 100.00 | Uber Localiza→Airbnb (Diego) | Beach cash (Tyler) | Different | ✓ Kept both |

**Result**: After removing 4 duplicates (R$ 4,382.00), final ledger: **66 unique expenses (R$ 72,798.09)**

### Why Two Separate Ledgers?

| Aspect | Chat-ledger | Splitwise |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Tracking method** | Manual via group chat | Formal expense app |
| **Coverage** | Subset of trips expenses | Different subset |
| **Dates** | Missing (expenses logged without dates) | Full date tracking (2025-12-28 to 2026-01-19) |
| **Examples** | Wine, dinners, rides, groceries (early tracking) | Airbnb (R$ 8,051 × 2), car rental (R$ 4,728), boat (R$ 6,500) |
| **Purpose** | Daily spending tracking during trip | Final reconciliation/accounting |

### Combined Ledger Status

✅ **Deduplication complete**: 4 duplicates removed, 66 unique expenses remain
✅ **Source field preserved**: 'chatgpt' or 'splitwise' for each expense
✅ **Math verified**: All rows balanced, ledger sums to zero
✅ **Settlement ready**: 6 creditors owed R$ 34,537.19 by 8 debtors

### Meal Assignment & Base Prices

| Person | Meal Description | Base Price (R$) |
|--------|------------------|----------------:|
| **David** | Salmão Pesto | 74.80 |
| **Joseph** | Pêssego + Cabra + Brócolis Assado Picante + Tofu Orgânico + Dijon/Balsamico/Mel | 88.70 + 6.00 + 14.90 + 7.00 = 116.60 |
| **Diego** | Salada Frango Pesto Parm + Frango Grelhado em Cubos | 75.70 + 14.90 = 90.60 |
| **Antonio** | Monte seu bowl + Homus + Steak Grelhado com Alho | 82.70 + 10.90 + 21.90 = 115.50 |
| **Nick** | Missô Bowl com Frango Crispy | 54.90 |
| **Bruna** | Missô Bowl com Frango Crispy | 48.90 |
| | **Subtotal** | **R$ 425.70** |

---

### Fees & Discounts Summary

| Item | Amount (R$) |
|------|------------:|
| **Subtotal (6 meals)** | 425.70 |
| **Coupon** | −10.00 |
| **Delivery Fee** | 17.99 |
| **Service Fee** | 1.99 |
| **TOTAL ORDER** | **435.68** |

---

### Pro-Ration Methodology

Instead of splitting the total equally (which would be unfair to those who ordered cheaper meals), we used a **proportional distribution** based on each person's meal base price.

#### Step 1: Calculate each person's proportion of the meal subtotal
- **Total meal subtotal**: R$ 425.70
- Each person's proportion = `(Their Base Price) ÷ 425.70`

#### Step 2: Apply proportion to adjustments
- **Net adjustment** = (Coupon) + (Delivery) + (Service) = −10.00 + 17.99 + 1.99 = **+9.98**
- Each person pays their proportion of the +R$ 9.98

#### Step 3: Final per-person cost
- **Final share** = Base Price + (Proportion × 9.98)

---

### Final Per-Person Breakdown

| Person | Base Price (R$) | % of Subtotal | Adjustment (R$) | Final Share (R$) |
|--------|----------------:|---------------:|----------------:|-----------------:|
| **David** | 74.80 | 17.58% | 1.71 | **76.51** |
| **Joseph** | 116.60 | 27.39% | 2.73 | **119.33** |
| **Diego** | 90.60 | 21.28% | 2.12 | **92.72** |
| **Antonio** | 115.50 | 27.15% | 2.71 | **118.21** |
| **Nick** | 54.90 | 12.90% | 1.29 | **56.19** |
| **Bruna** | 48.90 | 11.48% | 1.15 | **50.05** |
| | | | | |
| **TOTAL** | 425.70 | 100% | 10.00 | **435.70** |

---

### Why This Methodology?

**❌ Not split equally**: If we split R$ 435.68 equally among 6 people = R$ 72.61 each
- **Problem**: Nick & Bruna ordered cheaper meals but would pay the same as Joseph & Antonio who ordered premium meals with add-ons
- **Unfair**: Penalizes people with cheaper orders

**✅ Proportional pro-ration**: Each person pays their share of fees based on what they ordered
- **Benefit**: People who ordered expensive meals pay more fees; people who ordered cheap meals pay fewer fees
- **Fair**: Aligns costs with consumption
- **Standard practice**: This is how restaurants/platforms typically handle split bills

**Result**: The R$ 9.98 adjustment was distributed fairly across all 6 people.
