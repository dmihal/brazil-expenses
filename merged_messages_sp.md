1. **system:** (2026-01-16T00:46:50.173149Z) **David Mihal** created the group chat.

2. **user:** (2026-01-16T00:47:28.439751Z) You are gonna help us track our expenses split between a group. There are... It'll be like Splitwise. There are eight of us. There's Bruna, there's Nick, there's Diego, there's Estella, there's Alex, and there's Kala, and there's me, David. There's also Tyler, who will be joining us later, but he's not here yet. So whenever we add an expense, you split it between the people who it's responsible for.

3. **assistant:** (2026-01-16T00:47:38.847593Z) Got it 👍 I can act like a simple “Splitwise” for this group and keep a running ledger.

Here’s what I understand so far:

**Group members (8 total, eventually):**  
- Bruna  
- Nick  
- Diego  
- Estella  
- Alex  
- Kala  
- David  
- Tyler (will join later)

I can:
- Record each expense  
- Split it among the people responsible  
- Keep track of who owes whom  
- Show balances anytime

To set this up cleanly, I just need a couple quick rules from you:

4. **Default split:**  
   Should expenses be split *equally* among the selected people unless you say otherwise?

5. **Currency:**  
   What currency are you using?

6. **How you’ll log expenses:**  
   For example, are you okay with a format like:  
   > “David paid 120 for dinner for Bruna, Nick, and David”

Once you confirm these, we can start. You can add the first expense whenever you’re ready. 💸📊

7. **user:** (2026-01-16T00:48:15.562989Z) Split this, everyone except Tyler. And it's spelled Kalle

8. **assistant:** (2026-01-16T00:48:31.203026Z) Perfect, thanks — and noted: **Kalle** (not Kala). ✅

From the receipt, the **total is 1,571.60** and it even shows **7 people**, which matches “everyone except Tyler.”

So this expense is split between:  
**Bruna, Nick, Diego, Estella, Alex, Kalle, David** (7 people)

**Equal split:**  
1,571.60 ÷ 7 = **224.51 each**

Before I lock this into the ledger, I just need **one thing**:

👉 **Who paid this bill?**

Once you tell me who paid, I’ll record it and update who owes whom.

9. **user:** (2026-01-16T00:52:40.057298Z) Me

10. **assistant:** (2026-01-16T00:52:50.506448Z) Got it — **David paid.** ✅ I’ve logged this expense.

12. **user:** (2026-01-16T23:28:28.168860Z) David, Kalle, Olga, Tyler dinner total was 968.41

13. **assistant:** (2026-01-16T23:28:35.095672Z) Got it — I can log this one 👍  
I just need a couple of quick clarifications before I add it to the ledger:

14. **Who paid the 968.41?**  
15. **Is the split equal** between **David, Kalle, Olga, and Tyler** (4 people)?  
16. **Olga** is new — should I add her as a new group member going forward?

Once you answer those, I’ll record it and update everyone’s balances.

17. **user:** (2026-01-16T23:29:00.426643Z) Tyler paid, split equal

18. **assistant:** (2026-01-16T23:29:09.623326Z) Perfect 👍 I’ve logged it.

### 🧾 Expense recorded

- **Total:** 968.41  
- **Paid by:** Tyler  
- **Split equally between (4):** David, Kalle, Olga, Tyler

### 💸 Balances from this expense

- **Kalle → owes Tyler:** 242.10  
- **Olga → owes Tyler:** 242.10  
- **Tyler:** paid 968.41, his own share is 242.10, so he is **owed 726.31**

I’ve also **added Olga** to the group going forward.

If you want, next I can:
- Show the **full group balance summary**, or  
- Log the **next expense** right away.

22. **user:** (2026-01-18T01:19:31.623254Z) Please split this across Estella Alex College Olga Diego Tyler Bruner and Davie

23. **assistant:** (2026-01-18T01:19:41.139044Z) Got it ✅ I’ll split it across:

**Estella, Alex, College, Olga, Diego, Tyler, Bruner, Davie** *(8 people)*

From the receipt, the **Total Conta = 1,806.87**.

### 💰 Equal split
**1,806.87 ÷ 8 = 225.86 each** (rounded to cents)

### ✅ Amount each person owes (their share)
- Estella: **225.86**
- Alex: **225.86**
- College: **225.86**
- Olga: **225.86**
- Diego: **225.86**
- Tyler: **225.86**

- Davie: **225.86**

Quick check: 225.86 × 8 = 1,806.88 (1 cent over due to rounding)

➡️ **Who paid this bill?** (so I can record who everyone owes)

24. **user:** (2026-01-18T01:19:51.873241Z) Nick did

### 💸 Who owes Nick
- Estella → **225.86**
- Alex → **225.86**
- College → **225.86**

- Diego → **225.86**

Want me to show the **full balance summary** across all expenses so far?

26. **user:** (2026-01-18T01:20:22.233388Z) Kalle not college

27. **assistant:** (2026-01-18T01:20:29.354593Z) Ahh got it ✅ **Kalle, not “College.”** Thanks!

I’ll update that last expense to be split across:

**Estella, Alex, Kalle, Olga, Diego, Tyler, Bruner, Davie** *(8 people)*

Everything else stays the same:
- **Total:** 1,806.87  
- **Paid by:** Nick  
- **Each share:** 225.86 (with 1-cent rounding handled)

So **Kalle owes Nick 225.86** (instead of “College”).

33. **user:** (2026-01-21T19:26:03.050378Z) Here's two receipts split with me kalle and Olga paid by me

34. **assistant:** (2026-01-21T19:26:26.063810Z) Got it — I’ll treat these as **two expenses**, both **paid by David**, split equally between **David, Kalle, and Olga**.

From the receipts:

---

## 🧾 Expense 1 — Bike rental  
**Total:** 54.00  
**Paid by:** David  
**Split between:** David, Kalle, Olga (3)

**Split:** 54.00 ÷ 3 = **18.00 each**

➡️ **Kalle owes David:** 18.00  
➡️ **Olga owes David:** 18.00  

---

## 🧾 Expense 2 — Restaurant (Vista São Paulo)  
**Total:** 740.15  
**Paid by:** David  
**Split between:** David, Kalle, Olga (3)

740.15 ÷ 3 = **246.716…**

To keep cents clean, I’ll record:  
- **David:** 246.71  
- **Kalle:** 246.72  
- **Olga:** 246.72  

(so the total matches exactly)

➡️ **Kalle owes David:** 246.72  
➡️ **Olga owes David:** 246.72  

---

## 💸 New amounts owed to David from these two receipts
- **Kalle → David:** 18.00 + 246.72 = **264.72**  
- **Olga → David:** 18.00 + 246.72 = **264.72**

Both are now logged into the group ledger ✅  
Send the next one whenever you’re ready.
